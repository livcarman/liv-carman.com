      <section id="about">
        <p class="mb-4">
          I'm a full-stack software engineer who's especially interested in helping small teams turn their MVPs
          into reliable, scalable, and maintainable commercial software.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Currently, I'm software engineer number four at
          <a class="font-bold hover:text-blue-600" href="https://sitewire.co" norel nofollow>Sitewire</a>, an
          early-stage startup that's helping lenders and borrowers digitize the draw process for construction loans.
          I've designed and built projects that touch every part of our platform: the iOS and Android mobile apps, the
          web dashboard, our public API, our experiments with AI, and the infrastructure that powers it all.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In the past, I've had the chance to work on full-stack projects at other early-stage startups like
          <a class="font-bold hover:text-blue-600" href="https://rhumbix.com" norel nofollow>Rhumbix</a>,
          <a class="font-bold hover:text-blue-600" href="https://bigeye.com" norel nofollow>Bigeye</a>,
          and
          <a class="font-bold hover:text-blue-600" href="https://standardmetrics.io" norel nofollow>Standard Metrics</a>.
          I've also worked on small, independent teams building brand new products inside of larger orgs, like the
          <a class="font-bold hover:text-blue-600" href="https://babylist.com/health" norel nofollow>Babylist Health</a>
          team at Babylist and the
          <a class="font-bold hover:text-blue-600" href="https://www.corteva.us/products-and-solutions/pasture-management/landvisor.html" norel nofollow>LandVisor</a>
          team at Granular (now a part of Corteva).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I like roles where I have a lot of ownership over what I'm building and know that my work is having a direct
          impact on the business. New products are extra fun to work on: when a product idea collides with the reality
          of the market and customer feedback, it creates so many interesting problems that I think are fun to solve.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Outside of work, I play the guitar and drums, try out new recipes, and read a lot (mostly literary fiction
          and history). I'm a lifelong fan of the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres, which has mostly been tragic. I'm
          curious about the world and love learning new things.
        <p>
